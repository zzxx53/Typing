# Typing
This is a javascript-based typing web app that allows the users to paste in the text from any source and then use that as material for typing practice. This project started from my personal experience that many typing practice sites only allows typing practice using a limited library of text, and that could get boring. 

To use, just open the index.html file in a browser.
